      <h1 class="mt-1"> Research Statement/Ambitions/Interest </h1>
      <p><strong>Ultimate goal:</strong> Building a robot (an artificial system, can be humanoid or form-less) whose semantic mapping is atleast as good as humans, and utilises the memory capabilities a computer offers .i.e., a robot with which a person can have deep conversations. A robot companion. </p>

      <p><strong>Why do I want it?</strong><br> A rudimentary answer would be that thousands of hours of sci-fi works I have been indulged in, since childhood, inspired me to aim for it, and my scientific pursuits powered me to ask why not! <br> A more formal answer woudl be as following. I look at technology is something that has been iterating, since fire, to help humans. It must exist and progress towards helping humans in their daily tasks. But recent progress is AI is ‚Äúmajorly‚Äù aimed at helping a small set of individuals or institutions. Currently, its major application is helping institutions strive by providing what a user expects from their platform. But, there has been not much improvement in AI which helps humans as a real assistant (like Tony Stark's Jarvis). I believe more efforts should be pushed towards making AI individual centric, than the application centric.</p>


      <p><strong>How do I want to achieve it?</strong><br> Such an artficial system should possess a great semantic mapping, should be able to process multimodal data and map relationships among them. Insights from how humans learn from such low amounts of data, and so quickly, can help us give insights in building such efficient artificial models. I believe some efforts can be put towards translating the genetic advantage we have into the architectures choice and pre-training. For example, efforts by labs like Numenta work on improving the models for natural neurons. Conversation is a crucial part of our life and thought process. Speech, language are major parts of our conversation, but need not be the most important things. Body language, emotions, context convey a lot. Two humans need not know same language (need not speak a language at all) to converse. This, and the fact that we can converse with our pets, shows that our conversations are not limited to language (text and speech) processing, but it is used to raise the abstract level for more complex ideas. Basic (subjectively) conversation can happen with the visual and temporal information. The urge for survival is the common language for all organisms, and it enabled us to evolve towards where we are currently.</p>

      <p>To conclude, I want to build a system that can process mutlimodal information, consists robust semantic mapping for the objects represented in the these different modalities (which also combines the temporal and visual contexts), and has ability to plan like us. To do this, my current knowledge in AI/ML and Neuroscience has provided me insights about perception models, and I want to learn more in this domain to move in this direction more formally. Currently, I understand the learning principles for processing temporal, visual and multi-modal data in artificial systems, and have been exposed to them in human brain. I look forward to understand more of that, and combine it with Reinforcement Learning to achieve my goal. </p>

      <p><strong>What do I want to do with it?</strong> <br>To answer in short, I want to use that solution as next step in human evolution. I believe it needs to be democratized and every human (can extend to pets, or other organisms also) must be able to access it, to extend their capabilities. I want to use it to help humans evolve in better direction. </p>
